# Methods

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process for a recycling app that is aimed to recycle glass bottles, tin cans, cardboard, and plastic bottles using object detection algorithm involves several methods to ensure the app is effective and efficient in achieving its objectives.

The first method is data collection. The app will require a large amount of data to train its object detection algorithm to recognize recyclable items accurately. The app developers can collect data by taking pictures of the recyclable items or sourcing for existing datasets. The collected data should be comprehensive, diverse, and relevant to ensure the object detection algorithm can accurately identify the recyclable items. Then, The collected data will require preprocessing to clean it and prepare it for analysis. Data preprocessing involves tasks such as data cleaning, data normalization, data transformation, and data reduction. These tasks ensure that the data is in the right format, is accurate, and is ready for analysis.

Data visualization involves creating visual representations of the data to help the developers and users of the app understand the data better. The developers can use visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts to understand the distribution of the data, identify patterns, and detect outliers.

Feature engineering involves selecting the most important features from the data and creating new features to improve the accuracy of the object detection algorithm. The developers can use techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), feature selection algorithms, and clustering algorithms to identify the most important features.

Model building involves developing a machine learning model that can accurately detect and classify the recyclable items. The developers can use algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Random Forests to build the model. The model should be trained using the preprocessed data, and the performance should be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Model deployment involves integrating the trained model into the app and making it available to users. The app should have a user-friendly interface that allows users to take pictures of the recyclable items and receive a recycling price suggestion based on the number of items detected. The app should also notify pickers in the near me area about the ad posted about the recycling item along with the suggested price so that they can pick up the recyclables and take them to the nearest recycling place to get the approximate payment.

In conclusion, the EDA process for a recycling app that is aimed to recycle glass bottles, tin cans, cardboard, and plastic bottles using object detection algorithm involves several methods, including data collection, data preprocessing, data visualization, feature engineering, model building, and model deployment.

Once the images have been identified and categorized, the next step is to ensure that the data is consistent and accurate. This involves identifying and correcting any errors or inconsistencies in the data, such as missing values, duplicate entries, or incorrect labels. For example, if there are multiple entries for the same item with different labels or values, these must be corrected to ensure that the data is consistent and accurate.

The data must also be processed to ensure that it is in a format that can be easily analyzed and modeled. This includes converting the raw data into a structured format, such as a table or spreadsheet, with columns and rows that can be easily analyzed and manipulated. The data must also be transformed and cleaned to remove any outliers or anomalies that could skew the analysis or modeling.

During the cleaning and processing of the data, it is important to ensure that the privacy and security of users' data are protected. This includes ensuring that the data is stored securely and that access is restricted to authorized personnel only. The app must also comply with all relevant data protection and privacy regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Data Collection and Pre-processing: The first step in any data analysis project is to collect and clean the data. In the context of the recycling app, this would involve collecting images of the recyclable objects such as glass bottles, tin cans, cardboard, and plastic bottles. These images can be obtained from various sources such as the internet, social media platforms, or crowdsourcing. The data should be pre-processed to ensure that it is in a format that is suitable for analysis. This could involve resizing, normalizing, and cropping the images.

Data Visualization: Data visualization is a powerful tool for understanding the data and identifying patterns. Histograms and box plots can be used to visualize the distribution of the variables, while scatter plots can be used to visualize the relationship between variables. In the context of the recycling app, histograms and box plots can be used to visualize the distribution of the number of objects detected in each image, while scatter plots can be used to visualize the relationship between the type of object detected and the location where it was detected.

Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis can provide insights into the dataset and help identify trends and patterns. Measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance can be used to describe the dataset. In the context of the recycling app, statistical analysis can be used to determine the average number of objects detected in each image and the distribution of the types of objects detected.

Machine Learning Techniques: Machine learning techniques such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and classification can be used to identify patterns and relationships in the data. In the context of the recycling app, clustering can be used to group images with similar types and numbers of objects, while classification can be used to categorize images based on the type of object detected.

Data Augmentation: Data augmentation is the process of generating additional data from the existing dataset. This can be done by adding noise to the data, rotating the images, or flipping them horizontally or vertically. In the context of the recycling app, data augmentation can be used to generate additional images of the same objects from different angles and perspectives.

In summary, the EDA process for a recycling app that uses object detection algorithms involves collecting and pre-processing the data, visualizing the data using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, conducting statistical analysis to describe the dataset, using machine learning techniques such as clustering and classification to identify patterns and relationships in the data, and using data augmentation to generate additional data. By conducting a thorough EDA process, we can gain a deeper understanding of the dataset and make informed decisions about the machine learning models that we develop for the recycling app.
