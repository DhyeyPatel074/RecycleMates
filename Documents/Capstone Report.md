# Exploratory Data Analysis

Data Collection and Pre-processing: The first step in any data analysis project is to collect and clean the data. In the context of the recycling app, this would involve collecting images of the recyclable objects such as glass bottles, tin cans, cardboard, and plastic bottles. These images can be obtained from various sources such as the internet, social media platforms, or crowdsourcing. The data should be pre-processed to ensure that it is in a format that is suitable for analysis. This could involve resizing, normalizing, and cropping the images.

Data Visualization: Data visualization is a powerful tool for understanding the data and identifying patterns. Histograms and box plots can be used to visualize the distribution of the variables, while scatter plots can be used to visualize the relationship between variables. In the context of the recycling app, histograms and box plots can be used to visualize the distribution of the number of objects detected in each image, while scatter plots can be used to visualize the relationship between the type of object detected and the location where it was detected.

Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis can provide insights into the dataset and help identify trends and patterns. Measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance can be used to describe the dataset. In the context of the recycling app, statistical analysis can be used to determine the average number of objects detected in each image and the distribution of the types of objects detected.

Machine Learning Techniques: Machine learning techniques such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and classification can be used to identify patterns and relationships in the data. In the context of the recycling app, clustering can be used to group images with similar types and numbers of objects, while classification can be used to categorize images based on the type of object detected.

Data Augmentation: Data augmentation is the process of generating additional data from the existing dataset. This can be done by adding noise to the data, rotating the images, or flipping them horizontally or vertically. In the context of the recycling app, data augmentation can be used to generate additional images of the same objects from different angles and perspectives.

In summary, the EDA process for a recycling app that uses object detection algorithms involves collecting and pre-processing the data, visualizing the data using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, conducting statistical analysis to describe the dataset, using machine learning techniques such as clustering and classification to identify patterns and relationships in the data, and using data augmentation to generate additional data. By conducting a thorough EDA process, we can gain a deeper understanding of the dataset and make informed decisions about the machine learning models that we develop for the recycling app.

# Performance metrics

Precision: This measures the accuracy of the model's predictions. It is calculated by dividing the number of correctly identified recyclable items by the total number of identified items. A high precision value indicates that the model has few false positives, or items that were identified as recyclable but are not.

Recall: This measures the model's ability to identify all the relevant recyclable items in the dataset. It is calculated by dividing the number of correctly identified items by the total number of recyclable items in the dataset. A high recall value indicates that the model has few false negatives, or items that were not identified as recyclable but are.

F1 Score: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It is used to give equal weight to both precision and recall. A high F1 score indicates that the model is both precise and has a high recall rate.

Mean Average Precision (MAP): This is used to evaluate the accuracy of the model at different thresholds. It is calculated by taking the average of the precision values at different recall levels.
To ensure that the model is performing well, it is important to evaluate it on a diverse range of data that includes different types of recyclable items, different lighting conditions, and different backgrounds. The model's performance should be evaluated periodically and adjusted as needed to maintain its accuracy.

It is also important to consider the computational resources required to run the object detection algorithm. The size of the dataset and the complexity of the model can greatly impact the computational resources required to run the algorithm. It is important to strike a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency to ensure that the model can run in real-time on mobile devices.

Another important factor to consider is the impact of false positives and false negatives. False positives can result in non-recyclable items being identified as recyclable, which can result in contamination of the recycling stream. False negatives, on the other hand, can result in recyclable items being missed, which can reduce the effectiveness of the recycling program. It is important to minimize both false positives and false negatives to ensure that the model is effective in identifying recyclable items. Here is a Confusion matrix representing false positives and false negatives of the base model:

In conclusion, evaluating the performance of a recycling app that uses object detection algorithms is essential to ensure that the app is accurate and effective. Performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score and mAP can be used to evaluate the model's accuracy, and it is important to consider the impact of false positives and false negatives. The computational resources required to run the algorithm should also be considered, and the model's performance should be evaluated periodically to maintain its accuracy.

# Limitations

More images to train the neural network model as they require a lot of pictures to really get high accuracy.

While the recycling app described has numerous benefits, there are also some limitations to consider. One of the biggest limitations is the accuracy of the object detection algorithm. While it has been shown to be effective in identifying and categorizing items, there is still room for error. For example, the algorithm may have difficulty differentiating between two similar-looking items, such as a plastic water bottle and a sports drink bottle. This could result in inaccurate pricing suggestions or misclassification of recyclables. Another limitation of the app is the reliance on user-generated content. While this is a key feature that allows users to post ads for their recyclables, it also means that the quality and accuracy of the information provided can vary. Users may not always provide accurate descriptions or pricing suggestions for their recyclables, which could impact the effectiveness of the app in connecting pickers with recyclers.

Another potential limitation is the need for a reliable internet connection. Without a stable and fast internet connection, users may have difficulty accessing the app, uploading photos, or receiving notifications about new ads. This could limit the app's effectiveness, particularly in areas with poor internet connectivity or in regions where access to mobile data is limited. The app may also face challenges in terms of user adoption and engagement. While there is a growing interest in sustainability and recycling, not all users may be willing or able to use the app. Some users may prefer to recycle through more traditional means, such as taking their recyclables directly to a recycling center. Others may be hesitant to use the app due to concerns about privacy or security.

In addition, the app may face challenges in terms of scaling and sustainability. As the app becomes more popular and attracts a larger user base, there may be increased demands on the server infrastructure and technical support. This could require significant investments in technology and personnel to maintain and scale the app. Furthermore, the app's effectiveness may be limited by regulatory or policy factors. For example, some areas may have restrictions on the types of recyclables that can be collected or the prices that can be offered for recycling. These regulations may vary by region or country, which could impact the app's ability to function effectively in certain areas.

Finally, the app may face challenges in terms of financial sustainability. While the app's revenue model is based on a percentage of the transaction fees between the pickers and recyclers, it may take time for the app to attract a large enough user base to generate significant revenue. In the meantime, the app may require ongoing investments in marketing, technology, and personnel to continue operating.

In conclusion, while the recycling app has the potential to revolutionize the way we recycle, it is important to consider the potential limitations and challenges. By understanding and addressing these limitations, we can work towards building a more effective and sustainable recycling app that benefits both individuals and the environment.
